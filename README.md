Getting to Grips with coding in C++

As someone who had no real experience with coding until university, I want to become familar with a vast quantity of languages.
C and C++ in particular intrigue me through the level of memory manipulation you can acheive, so i wanted to create a small program to help understand the basics.

I'm very interested to learn more about the industry and hope to be able to do so at your company.

My Snake game was developed with reference to a tutorial for c++, and I created the Space invaders game on my own using what i had learned from that.
Both were created to be played in native C, so apologies for the flickering visuals of the command window, especially for monitors with high refresh rates.
